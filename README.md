An Nmap service version scan on host "uhuntu" having the IP address 10.0.2.15 was conducted on August 14, 2025. The result was that the host is active and reachable with very low latency. Out of 1,000 TCP ports, one port was found to be open, which is port 80.
Port 80 is generally utilized for HTTP traffic, and in this case, it is running the Apache HTTP Server, release 2.4.58, on Ubuntu. This indicates that the host is functioning as a web server. Apache is a widely-used web server program that delivers web pages to customers via the internet or local network.
The open port 80 and content serving show that the machine is externally or internally accessible for web communication. While this is the desired behavior from a web server that hosts sites or web applications, it also means that the system can be threatened if it is not properly secured. Apache version 2.4.58 should be monitored to keep it updated and free of known vulnerabilities.
In essence, there is only a single open port on the host, which is Apache HTTP Server's port 80. This means that the system is being used to serve web content, and even if it can be performing its function, caution should still be exercised in order to patch, configure, and limit access in order to secure.
